# Music
Music has been one of my biggest passions for as long as I can remember. Music is a very personal thing for me and where a lot of my self expression comes from. I listen to a lot of different types of music and I always love finding new music artists but some of my favorites are
 - Sewerperson
 - Brakence
 - Glaive
 - Midwxst
 - Aldn
 - And many many many more that I can't fit into this list...

## Concerts
Now that COVID conditions have started to improve, I have already been going to a lot of concerts! Concerts are something my dad and I love to go to. We've traveled to a lot of places and made a lot of great memories from the concerts we have been to.
